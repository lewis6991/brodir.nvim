*dirvish.txt*	directory viewer

==============================================================================
OVERVIEW                                                             *dirvish*

Dirvish is a minimalist directory viewer. It basically dumps a list of paths
into a Vim buffer and provides some sugar to work with those paths. It works
with built-in Vim mechanisms instead of inventing peripheral imitations.

Because each Dirvish buffer-name is the literal directory path, you can |:cd|
to the directory, >
  :cd %
create a new file, >
  :edit %/foo.txt
|expand()| the directory path, >
  :let &titlestring = expand('%', 1)
and use complementary plugin commands like |]f|/|[f| (unimpaired.vim).

Because each dirvish buffer is just a list of paths, you can use normal Vim
commands to |y|ank, |:read|, |gf|, etc. The built-in CTRL-W mappings also work
as expected.

It's totally fine to slice, dice, and smash any Dirvish buffer: it will never
modify the filesystem. If you edit the buffer, Dirvish automatically disables
|conceal| so you can see the full text.

Dirvish is designed to work with built-in Vim concepts where possible. Tim
Pope's plugins demonstrate this theme; more plugins should too. Re-use of
concepts multiplies the utility of those concepts; conversely if a plugin does
not reuse a concept, both that concept and the new one are made mutually less
valuable--the sum is less than the parts--because the user must learn or
choose from two slightly different things instead of one augmented system.

OPTIONS                                                      *dirvish-options*

g:dirvish_mode = 1                                  *g:dirvish_mode*
    Controls which files are listed and how they are presented.
    1:        'suffixes' and 'wildignore' determine sorting and visibility.
    2:        Shows all files, in the order returned by |glob()|.
    ":{cmd}": Ex-command |:execute|d after listing files.

    Mnemonic: higher number => more files.

|BufNew| fires the first time a directory is opened (and not yet loaded).
Note: Use expand("<afile>") to get the new buffer name (not "%").

|FileType| fires after Dirvish has loaded: all mappings, options, and content
can be overridden by handling that event. Example: >

    augroup dirvish_config
      autocmd!

      " Map `t` to open in new tab.
      autocmd FileType dirvish
        \  nnoremap <silent><buffer> t :call dirvish#open('tabedit', 0)<CR>
        \ |xnoremap <silent><buffer> t :call dirvish#open('tabedit', 0)<CR>

      " Map `gr` to reload.
      autocmd FileType dirvish nnoremap <silent><buffer>
        \ gr :<C-U>Dirvish %<CR>

      " Map `gh` to hide dot-prefixed files.  Press `R` to "toggle" (reload).
      autocmd FileType dirvish nnoremap <silent><buffer>
        \ gh :silent keeppatterns g@\v/\.[^\/]+/?$@d _<cr>:setl cole=3<cr>
    augroup END

FAQ                                                              *dirvish-faq*

How do I control where Dirvish opens split windows? ~
Set the Vim options 'splitbelow' and 'splitright'.

How do I group (sort) directories/folders? ~
Sort folders at the top: >
    :sort ,^.*[\/],
Sort folders at the bottom: >
    :sort ,^.*[^\/],
To make this automatic, set |g:dirvish_mode|: >
    let g:dirvish_mode = ':sort ,^.*[\/],'
If you use |g:dirvish_relative_paths|, try this: >
    let g:dirvish_mode = ':sort ,^\v(.*[\/])|\ze,'

How do I filter? ~
Use |:global| to delete lines matching any filter: >
    :g/foo/d
To make this automatic, set |g:dirvish_mode|: >
    let g:dirvish_mode = ':silent keeppatterns g/foo/d _'

How do I hide "hidden" (dot-prefixed) files? ~
Use |:global| to delete the paths with dot-prefixed files: >
    :g@\v/\.[^\/]+/?$@d
To "toggle", just reload.
To make this automatic, set |g:dirvish_mode|: >
    let g:dirvish_mode = ':silent keeppatterns g@\v/\.[^\/]+/?$@d _'
You could also use a FileType autocmd: >
    autocmd FileType dirvish silent keeppatterns g@\v/\.[^\/]+/?$@d _
To un-hide, just undo. To hide again, reload.

How do I disable a Dirvish mapping? ~
As noted in |dirvish-options|, the way to customize Dirvish is to handle its
FileType event. For example if you have a global <C-p> mapping and you don't
want Dirvish to "shadow" it, :unmap the Dirvish buffer-local mapping: >

    augroup dirvish_config
      autocmd!
      autocmd FileType dirvish silent! unmap <buffer> <C-p>
    augroup END

You could use ":mapclear <buffer>" to delete ALL of the mappings.

Why does Dirvish report "invalid directory" for a path that contains unusual ~
characters (e.g. brackets "[]")? ~
Check your 'isfname' setting. On Windows (where filepaths may contain
backslashes "\") |fnamemodify()| may produce nonsense if 'isfname' does not
contain the aforementioned unusual characters.

How to override the netrw :Explore, :Sexplore, :Vexplore commands? ~
Put this in your vimrc: >

    let g:loaded_netrwPlugin = 1
    command! -nargs=? -complete=dir Explore Dirvish <args>
    command! -nargs=? -complete=dir Sexplore belowright split | silent Dirvish <args>
    command! -nargs=? -complete=dir Vexplore leftabove vsplit | silent Dirvish <args>
